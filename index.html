<h2><i>I...</i></h2>
<p>
I’m 28 years old, married + a baby boy and a dog.</br>
I have been living in Kiryat Motzkipn for the past two years (but not able to sleep for the past 11 months thanks to the baby).</br> 
 Before the army, I studied Industrial and Management Practical Engineer and I had an interesting and challenging service. </br>
After the army I began working in a factory that specializes in creating capa for buildings. I was in charge of  Production Planning and Control. </br>
After 5.5 years I decided to quit and embark on a new journey – a new job, a new role and studying, all at the same time. 
 </br>
Today I’m the production manager in a factory that makes capa for roofs & buildings while trying to combine motherhood, a demanding job and </br>  my studies.</br>
